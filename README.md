## 👨‍💻 About me

I am Nam Anh, a young learner of data analytics and data science. My passion for these fields stems from my curiosity about the ever-growing world of data and its potential to transform businesses and societies.

I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in data analysis, visualisation, and interpretation through various online courses and projects. This GitHub page is where I can showcase my learning journey and share my projects with the community. From data preprocessing to machine learning algorithms and data visualisation, as well as business case studies, I enjoy working on a diverse range of projects.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub, and please feel free to reach out to me via my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/namanh-pham).
